This week I spent most of my time preparing for the group meeting, and learning JavaScript. I also created the base for my JavaScript page. The structure of the class is pretty different from any of the other classes I've been in at both USU and BYU-I. So, I spent a lot of my time figuring out the structure, assignments, how to turn things in, etc. I think I have a pretty decent handle on it at this point, but there are a few things that I still will need to figure out next week.

The group meeting went well this week. I was able to meet most of my group, but there were two members that didn't show up to the Thursday meeting. The original meeting was Tuesday at 7pm, but because new members got added to our group and there was some confusion on the time Zach and I were the only ones that were able to make it. We decided to go ahead and reschedule it when more members would come, which was Thursday at 7pm. It was unfortunate that final 2 members weren't able to make it but we made every effort to get them there.

Communications are going well. We have started a slack channel, and all our communications outside of the weekly meeting are happening there. This makes it pretty easy to check in and ask questions, or answer questions if need be. 

I think I'm growing ion managing my own time, study and research.
