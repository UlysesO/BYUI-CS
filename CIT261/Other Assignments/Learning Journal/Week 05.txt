I had a lot of fun this week with local storage. Using libraries, frameworks, etc. has always masked this away and I've never really done it in pure JS. It's a lot of fun being able to save something and see it come back when the page loads, as well as in the local storage viewer through chrome developer tools. Doing some testing, it seemed like you could store JS objects directly in local storage without stringify and parse. But, I wanted to be able to see what was actually in there in teh developer tools, so I used the JSON library.
