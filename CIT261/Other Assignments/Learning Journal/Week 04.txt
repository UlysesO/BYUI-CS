This week I learned just how long it can take to create a really expansive JSON object. It really made me appreciate everything that goes into the libraries and API's/databases that can generate this kind of stuff on the fly. I also had some fun with some AJAX requests. It's an interesting concept to make an AJAX request to your own server to pull a static JSON page, instead of just putting the object directly into your script file. I guess this would be useful if you're requesting it from multiple pages. However, it does make a lot more sense to request data using AJAX from a seperate entity.
