I was able to build a back end express based application that exposed authenticated end points to the the client. I utilized JavaScript based tools such as Mongoose, MongoDB, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to build the backend. On the client side I built an Angular based application, using the Angular Materials library to maintain a standard of style and device compatibility that is outlined in Google's Material Specifications. 

7. (Optional) Any other comments about the project?

The next step of this project for me would be error handling. Right now it only logs the error to the console, and doesn't inform the user that something went wrong.
