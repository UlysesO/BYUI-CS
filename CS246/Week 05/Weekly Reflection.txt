# 05 Ponder : Weekly Reflection

1. Describe one challenge your team experienced working on the Android activity.

Fully understanding what an intent is.

2. What is the difference between an Activity and an Intent?

an Activity is the screens/controls, while an intent sends data between activities. 

3. Describe how the onCreate() callback works.

onCreate is called every time the activity is 'created'. This allows you to pull the needed info from the intent, or initialize variables.

4. What's the biggest challenge you've experienced regarding Android development compared to pure Java development?

Understanding UI.

5. After completing the assignments this week, what questions do you still have?

intents are still a little unclear, but they seem to mostly work liek promises in JS.

6. A common Android-related interview question is "What's the difference between onPause() and onDestroy() and what kinds of things might you do in those functions?". How would you answer that question?

onPause happens when you leave the app while in an activity, onDestory happens when you leave the activity or when you hard close the app.
