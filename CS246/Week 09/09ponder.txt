6. Are there any issues related to your team or project you want to tell your instructor about?

There aren't any issues currently. It is a little stressful though, I think we didn't realize the true scope of every small thing that has to be completed to get this project running as expected. But, we're on track to make it happen so I'm not overly concerned about it. If it gets down to the end, there are some features we can cut if needed.
